📌 Personal Website Launched: www.vahabvahabov.site

I’m excited to announce that my personal website is now live. This platform was developed as a real-world application to practice and demonstrate my programming skills. It serves both as a portfolio and a point of interaction for users who wish to get in touch.

🔍 Website Sections:
About Me – A short biography and an overview of my technical journey

My Skills – Programming and technical skills I have acquired

Language Skills – Languages I can communicate in and their proficiency levels

Get in Touch – A contact form enabling direct communication with me

ℹ️ Note: The Projects section is currently under development and will be available soon.

🛠 Technologies & Functionality:
Backend: Java + Spring Boot (REST APIs, MVC architecture)

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Thymeleaf

Database: PostgreSQL

Email Integration: Messages submitted via the contact form are delivered directly to my email using Spring Boot Mail

Visual Effects: Typewriter animation, smooth transitions, interactive hover effects, and fully responsive design

Containerization: Docker support ensures environment-independent deployment

Hosting: Hosted on Render.com

Domain: www.vahabvahabov.site

This project reflects my ability to combine both backend and frontend technologies into a complete, functional, and user-friendly web application.
I would greatly appreciate any feedback or suggestions you may have!
